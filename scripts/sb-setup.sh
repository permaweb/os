# sb-setup.sh -- generate LapEE operator Secure Boot keys, sign the
# UKI, produce UEFI-enrolment artefacts.
#
# Secure Boot in v1.2.1 is operator-provisioned. Each operator:
#   1. Runs `sb-setup.sh keys' ONCE to generate a fresh PK/KEK/db set
#      per their machine. Keys live under `secureboot/', which is
#      .gitignored -- keys never leave the operator's host.
#   2. Runs `sb-setup.sh sign' after wrapping a runtime image to
#      sign the produced UKI with db.key.
#   3. Runs `sb-setup.sh enrol' once per Framework to produce the
#      .auth files that go on a separate FAT-formatted USB stick the
#      Framework reads during Secure Boot setup-mode enrolment.
#
# After enrolment, Secure Boot ON in the Framework BIOS will accept
# the signed UKI and reject anything else.
#
# Rationale (vs. signing with Microsoft shim): shim is a generic
# bootloader and bundles MOK which defeats the single-purpose
# attestation premise. LapEE's operator-owned key means the chain of
# trust terminates at a key the operator physically controls --
# matches the paper's "device identity anchored at the TPM vendor
# root via the EK certificate chain, operator-owned UEFI trust
# anchor via PK/KEK/db" statement.
#
# Required tools:
#   - openssl   (keys + self-sign certs)
#   - sbsign    (sbsigntool package; signs PE+COFF binaries)
#   - sbsigntool's efi-updatevar / cert-to-efi-sig-list / sign-efi-sig-list
#
# On macOS: the SB tooling was pulled from Homebrew, so we ship
# `lapee-build:local' (docker/Dockerfile) with sbsigntool +
# efitools preinstalled. `make toolchain' builds it; this script
# transparently falls back to `docker run' when sbsign / etc. are
# missing from the host PATH. On Linux: `apt install sbsigntool
# efitools' if you prefer to run the tools natively.

usage: sb-setup.sh <command>

Commands:
  keys         Generate operator PK/KEK/db keys under $SB_DIR.
               Run ONCE per operator. Keys never leave the host.

  sign         Sign the UKI at $BUILD_UKI using db.key. Writes
               $SIGNED_UKI; a separate step copies it over the
               unsigned UKI into the USB image.

  enrol        Produce UEFI enrolment .auth files in $SB_DIR/enrol/.
               Copy those to a separate FAT-formatted USB stick;
               plug that stick into the Framework, enter Secure Boot
               setup mode, and use the BIOS "enrol db/KEK/PK" UI
               (F2 -> Security -> Secure Boot).

  check        Print the state of everything. Keys exist? UKI signed?
                Enrolment artefacts ready?

  tools        Print what's installed and what's missing.

Enrolment procedure on the Framework 13:
  1. If you haven't yet: `./scripts/sb-setup.sh sign' -- this
     bakes the enrolment files above into the ESP root of
     build/images/lapee-usb.img alongside the signed UKI, so one stick
     covers both boot and enrolment. (Running `sign' after
     `enrol' picks up the newly-produced files; running `sign'
     before `enrol' is also fine -- rerun `sign' once `enrol'
     lands them.)
  2. Flash with:
       make write-image DEV=/dev/diskN IMAGE=build/images/lapee-usb.img
     Then plug the stick into the Framework.
  3. Power on, F2 to enter BIOS.
  4. Security -> Secure Boot -> Enter Setup Mode (clears factory
     Microsoft keys; takes the machine out of a trust-chain rooted
     at Redmond and into one rooted at your operator key).
  5. In Security -> Secure Boot -> Administer/Manage Secure Boot
     Keys, enrol in order: db, KEK, PK. For each: pick "Enroll"
     / "Append", browse to the stick, pick the .cer file (the
     BIOS file filter usually hides .auth; .cer is X509 DER and
     the format the UI expects), choose X509 format if prompted.
     PK last -- enrolling PK exits setup mode and re-enables
     Secure Boot on the operator chain.
  6. Save + exit. The Framework then boots the signed UKI from
     the same stick. The enrolment files stay on the ESP; they're
     harmless (their contents are public once enrolled in the
     firmware).

Format notes:
  .cer = X509 DER, ~870 bytes, for the BIOS UI file browser
  .auth = PKCS7-signed EFI_VARIABLE_AUTHENTICATION_2, ~2.2 KB,
          for the command-line `efi-updatevar' path on Linux
  .esl = EFI Signature List, for the LapEE setup-mode provisioner

If you prefer a separate enrolment stick: the files live at
secureboot/enrol/ on the host; copy to any FAT USB at root.
Single-stick is the cleaner default.

To revert to factory Microsoft keys: Security -> Secure Boot ->
Restore Factory Keys.
