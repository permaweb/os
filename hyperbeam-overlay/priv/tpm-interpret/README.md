# `~tpm-interpret@1.0` database

Static JSON database consumed by `src/hb_db_tpm.erl` at node startup.
Ships inside the HyperBEAM release; load-once, read-many.

Layout:

| file | content |
|---|---|
| `manufacturers.json` | TCG-assigned TPM vendor IDs → `{name, kind, notes}`. Key is the 4-byte ASCII id expressed as 8 hex chars (`"49465800"` = Infineon). Covers every public TCG vendor registration (about 27 entries). |
| `pcr-profiles/*.json` | Known PCR 0/1/7/4/11 values for specific firmware + Secure Boot configurations. Each file is one profile. |
| `uki-measurements/*.json` | Known UKI-style PCR 11/12/13 values for canonical kernel images. |
| `root-cas/*.pem` | Per-vendor EK root CA bundle. Used by the verifier to chain the EK cert. Ship actual vendor PEMs here (out-of-band sourced from the TPM vendor). The files are not checked in upstream because their redistribution licenses vary; a deploy repopulates `root-cas/` from its own trust bundle. |

PCR digests in `match_pcrs` are always **base64url-encoded SHA-256
digests (43 characters, no padding)** — the same encoding the
`~tpm-interpret@1.0/pcrs` output produces for each PCR's `digest`
field, and the same convention used by every other binary value on
the HyperBEAM wire. *Never* hex.

`match_pcrs` need not cover every PCR; a profile matches when *all*
keys it lists match the quoted values. So one profile can pin just
PCR 0 + PCR 7 and leave PCR 1 free for kernel-command-line variance.

## Contributing new profiles

1. Boot the target hardware into a trusted state.
2. Run `GET /~tpm@2.0a/attestation/verify~tpm-interpret@1.0` against
   the node and copy the `digest` values straight out of the `pcrs`
   section of the response. They are already base64url.
   (If you are measuring outside HB: the raw 32-byte SHA-256 digest
   passed through `hb_util:encode/1` or Python's
   `base64.urlsafe_b64encode(d).rstrip(b"=")`.)
3. Fill in the JSON and drop it in `pcr-profiles/`.
4. The matcher picks the first entry that matches all listed PCRs,
   so order of file inclusion doesn't matter for correctness — but
   include enough PCRs that your profile is distinctive.

## Current coverage

This is a deliberately-small seed. Rolling out to 90% coverage of
likely LapEE hardware is a data problem not a code problem: every
time a new laptop is onboarded, dropping a new JSON here is all
that's needed. The framework loads them all at startup.
