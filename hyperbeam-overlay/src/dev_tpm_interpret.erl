%%% @doc `~tpm-interpret@1.0' -- turn a verified LapEE TPM attestation
%%% into rich, human-readable AO-Core fields.
%%%
%%% The companion to `~tpm@2.0a'. `~tpm@2.0a' is responsible for the
%%% cryptographic chain (EK cert -> AK -> TPM2_Quote -> PCR 15 -> node
%%% message). This device is responsible for turning that chain into
%%% *meaning*: the TPM vendor, the firmware identity, the kernel
%%% identity, the IMA chain, any cross-references against a static
%%% database of known-good values.
%%%
%%% Exports
%%%
%%%   info        public surface description.
%%%   interpret   take a LapEE attestation envelope and return a
%%%               structured AO-Core message describing every piece
%%%               of evidence present in the envelope.
%%%   verify      shortcut: call `dev_tpm2:verify' first and, if it
%%%               passes, attach the interpretation. This is the
%%%               endpoint the user's target URL lands on:
%%%
%%%                 ~relay@1.0/call&relay-path="http://PEER/~tpm@2.0a/attestation"
%%%                     /verify~tpm-interpret@1.0

%%%                                 "which vendor CA verified this EK?")
%%%     pcr-profiles/*.json         known PCR 0/1/7 values for specific

%% @doc Fundamental quote-integrity check. The TPM's pcrDigest
%% field (now decoded into `claim.quote.pcr-digest') is defined
%% as the hash over the concatenation of the selected PCR values
%% in `pcrSelect' order. We recompute that digest and compare.
%%
%% A mismatch means one of:
%%   * the quote was not produced by the TPM that claims to have
%%     signed it (wrong PCRs fed in),
%%   * the envelope's `pcr-values' map was altered between the
%%     TPM signing and the envelope arriving here,
%%   * the pcrSelect / digest-alg are malformed.
%%
%% Any of those is a hard-stop for trusting the quote -- the
%% crypto signature check alone is insufficient because the
%% signature only binds the TPMS_ATTEST blob, not the unquoted
%% per-PCR byte strings that the envelope carries.
%%
%% The digest algorithm is inferred from the declared
%% pcr-digest-length: 20 -> SHA-1, 32 -> SHA-256, 48 -> SHA-384,
%% 64 -> SHA-512.

%% Three orthogonal evidence tiers compose here:
%%   tier 2 (kernel cmdline intent): `mem_encrypt=on' / `sme=on' /
%%           `kvm_intel.tdx=on' measured into PCR 12 via sd-stub.
%%   tier 3 (UKI-hash claim DB lookup): this PCR 11 UKI hash appears
%%           in our uki-measurements DB with `checks-tme: true'
%%           (the kernel's early init halts if TME is off).
%%   tier 4 (quoted-PCR-15-ok): PCR 15 is present in a signed quote,
%%           the quote PCR digest checks out, and the AK signature
%%           verifies.
%%
%% Any ONE tier alone is insufficient for a definitive "on":
%%   tier 2 alone = intent, not proof (a kernel could ignore the flag)
%%   tier 3 alone = capability (the kernel HAS the halt-check), but
%%                  we'd still want tier 4 to know halt didn't fire
%%   tier 4 alone = the node reached a quoted PCR15 state, but we
%%                  don't know what kernel policy ran
%%
%% The `enabled' field surfaces the composite verdict; the
%% `evidence' list lets policy engines require specific tier
%% combinations (e.g. "tier 2 + tier 3 + tier 4" for confidential-
%% compute, "tier 2 only" for development).
